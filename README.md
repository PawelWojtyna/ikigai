# ikigai
Visualization of Ikigai (Jap.: Purpose): a goal in person's life.

The core view is made with use of an SVG picture embedded inside a simple HTML web page.

All controls (radio buttons) have listeners on them and this limits scope of user interaction to just few clicks. No *reset* button is needed here: once user initializes the controls, they can manipulate radio buttons giving answers fitting to their situation, and there's no need to start over.

Control plane is written in JavaScript (ES6), no frameworks were considered to be used due to simplicity of this small project.

Plans for the nearest future include writing a simple set of unit tests.
